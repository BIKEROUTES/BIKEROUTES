# Industrial archaeology in Milan

With this short urban trip you'll have the chance to admire the massive industrial archaeology landmarks of Carroponte (ex Breda industries) and Falck steel industries with its old worker village of Villagio Falck.

We'll also go across a small street full of street art in the NoLo neighborhood, all by cutting through small and big parks.
