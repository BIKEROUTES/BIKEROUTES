# Industrial archaeology in Milan

With this short urban trip you'll have the chance to admire the massive industrial archaeology landmarks of Falck steel industries and Carroponte (ex Breda industries).

We'll also go across a small street full of street art in the NoLo neighborhood, all by cutting through small and big parks.
