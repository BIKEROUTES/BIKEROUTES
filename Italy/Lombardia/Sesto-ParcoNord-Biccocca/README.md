# Industrial archaeology in Milan.

With this short urban trip you'll have the chance to admire the massive industrial archaeology landmark of Carroponte.

We'll also go across the campus of Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca and a small street full of street art in the NoLo neighborhood, all by cutting through small and big parks.
