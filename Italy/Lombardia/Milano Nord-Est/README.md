# Milano Nord-Est

Short round trip that crosses the old and the new northeastern Milan.
In a few kilometers, you will see old-town streets, modern squares, brewpubs, brutalist architecture from the economic boom, a relaxing city cycling path, and one of the biggest parks in Milan.

## Lambrate - NoLo

Start from Lambrate, where you will cross its old city center, once outside Milan. After that, the path brings you straight to Piazza Morbegno, the center of NoLo, and its modern local nightlife.

## Martesana - Crescenzago

From NoLo, you will pedal a few minutes to reach the cycling path that follows Naviglio Martesana: at its start, you must stop for a beer at
Buttiga Martesana - you can then continue through the Martesana park until you reach Crescenzago and its old church - like Lambrate, this town was once outside Milan.

## Parco Lambro

The ending part brings you back to Lambrate crossing Parco Lambro, a beautiful park surrounding the Lambro river.
Lambro is the river that gives its name to Lambrate - and the ride will bring you back there in a few kilometers.
